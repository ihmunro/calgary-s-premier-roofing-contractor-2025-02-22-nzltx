            <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                <p class="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">Calgary's extreme weather conditions can take a severe toll on residential roofs. From heavy snowfall to intense summer storms, your roof faces numerous challenges throughout the year. Understanding proper maintenance is crucial for protecting your investment and ensuring your roof's longevity.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">1. Regular Professional Inspections</h2>
                <p>Schedule professional roof inspections at least twice a year, ideally in spring and fall. Calgary's harsh winters can cause significant damage, making spring inspections particularly important to assess any winter damage. Fall inspections help ensure your roof is prepared for the upcoming winter season. Professional roofers can identify potential issues before they become major problems, saving you money in the long run.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">2. Clean Your Gutters Regularly</h2>
                <p>Clogged gutters can lead to ice dams during winter and water damage throughout the year. Remove leaves, twigs, and debris at least twice annually. Pay special attention to this task in late fall after most leaves have fallen. Consider installing gutter guards to reduce debris accumulation and make maintenance easier.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">3. Address Snow and Ice Buildup</h2>
                <p>Calgary's heavy snowfall can create dangerous roof loads. While it's tempting to remove snow yourself, improper snow removal can damage your roof. Invest in a roof rake with a telescoping handle for safely removing snow from the ground. For ice dam prevention, ensure proper attic insulation and ventilation. If ice dams form, hire professionals who can safely remove them without damaging your roof.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">4. Monitor and Maintain Attic Ventilation</h2>
                <p>Proper attic ventilation is crucial in Calgary's climate. In winter, it prevents moisture buildup that can lead to mold and rot. In summer, good ventilation reduces heat buildup that can warp shingles and increase cooling costs. Check that vents are clear of obstruction and consider having a professional assess your attic's ventilation system annually.</p>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">5. Prompt Repairs and Maintenance</h2>
                <p>Address any roofing issues immediately. Small problems can quickly escalate, especially during extreme weather events. Watch for warning signs such as:</p>
                <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
                    <li>Missing or damaged shingles</li>
                    <li>Water stains on ceilings or walls</li>
                    <li>Granules in gutters</li>
                    <li>Daylight visible through roof boards</li>
                    <li>Sagging roof deck</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-12 mb-6">Professional Maintenance is Key</h2>
                <p>While some maintenance tasks can be performed by homeowners, professional expertise is essential for thorough roof care. Calgary's unique climate demands specialized knowledge and experience. Professional roofers understand local building codes, have proper safety equipment, and can identify potential issues that might be missed by untrained eyes.</p>
